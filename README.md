##Tickets, please!
by Dex Fitch

A tiny jQuery web app that emulates a movie ticket purchasing interface.

##Setup

Download project folder.

Run index.html in your browser.

Enjoy!

##Tests
Testing the JavaScript methods can be done via spec/spec-runner.html in the browser.

##Known Bugs
* Will make duplicate identical tickets, rather than just updating the displayed quantity.
* Cannot delete or change existing tickets.

##Motivation

To practice creating and using JS prototypes with jQuery, and practice using bootstrap more extensively.
